If a file does not exist, it is created empty unless -c or --no-create is specified.
By default, the current time is used unless a specific time is provided via -d, -r, or -t.
Supported date formats for -d include RFC3339, YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS, YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS, YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM, YYYY-MM-DD, HH:MM:SS, HH:MM.

Examples:
  touch file.txt                  # Create or update file.txt with current time
  touch -a file.txt               # Change only access time
  touch -d "2025-07-13 14:30" file.txt  # Set specific date and time
  touch -r ref.txt file.txt       # Use times from ref.txt
